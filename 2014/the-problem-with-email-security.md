So, what’s the problem with email security?

The connection between the user devices and services like Google or Yahoo Mail is secure and encrypted. However, from there onwards to the email servers in between and the recipients, there is no assurance on security of the message. End-to-end encryption delivers that security for the whole traversal on the Internet.

The private keys used for encryption are unencrypted within memory under Chrome’s sandbox. 

Further, encryption is meaningless if the bad guy has the keys

---

One billion emails sent per day by SendGrid get encrypted before going to the mail provider. Gmail, Yahoo and Aol are all supporting the encryption effort.

For email, SendGrid uses a transport socket layer which behaves much like web counterpart. It’s called opportunistic encryption and is designed to prevent passive wiretapping.
