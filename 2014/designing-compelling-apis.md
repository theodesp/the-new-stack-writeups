  REST APIs bring value to the companies and should not be difficult to implement them. An API should be treated as a first class citizen and taken care of.

---

  APIs can bring a lot of benefits including **monetization**, especially if its the primary product, **user engagement** with easier integration, **visibility** so that open source developer can interact with your system and **attraction** so you can have devoted users.

---

  To make your API worthwhile you need to have real use cases. Pick 3 use cases, think like the end user, present things in a unique way.

---

  Make the use case easy to understand for the non-technical people.

---

  Make things easy. Aim for pragmatic and not dogmatic REST practices. Avoid kiss of death when you have to make lots of calls to perform one goal.

---

  Finally don't forget to promote the API by sharing as much information as possible. Treat your developers as valued partners and not as objects.
