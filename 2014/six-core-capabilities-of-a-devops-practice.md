[Six Core Capabilities of a DevOps Practice](https://thenewstack.io/six-core-capabilities-of-a-devops-practice/)

DevOps is a term that reflects what happens when seeming disparate concepts are turned into a portmanteau.

---

Developers and operations have historically been separate organizations in IT due to the waterfall methodology. But more than ever, developers and operations need to have shared practices. 

---

1. Collaboration. Instead of pointing fingers at each other, development and IT operations work together. It may be difficult, even impossible, to eliminate silos, but collaboration is essential.

---

2. Automation is king. DevOps relies on toolchains to automate large parts of the end-to-end software development and deployment process.

---

 3. Continuous Integration. Developers have to communicate with each other much more frequently

---

4. Continuous Testing. The testing piece of DevOps is easy to overlookâ€”until you get burned. Continuous testing is not just a QA function, in fact, it starts in the development environment. Developers make sure that, along with delivering error-free code, they provide test data sets. They also help test engineers configure the testing environment to be as close to the production environment as possible.

---

5. Continuous Delivery. Taking continuous integration to the next step. The result is that individual releases are far less complex and come out much more frequently.

---

6. Continuous Monitoring.  Ideally in a DevOps environment, failures must be found and fixed in real time. How do you do that? A big part is continuous monitoring. The goals of continuous monitoring are to quickly determine when a service is unavailable, understand the underlying causes, and most importantly, apply these learnings to anticipate problems before they occur. Like testing, monitoring starts in development.
