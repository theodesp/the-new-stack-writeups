Cloud sourcing is an arrangement in which a company pays a third-party cloud hosting provider to deliver and support IT services that could be provided in-house.

Author dislikes Cloudsourcing. If we cloudsource common business task such as CRM, email, ERP, etc. we eventually outsource accountability and liability for data compliance and security.

SaaS providers give you a sharing model of computation or Shared Responsibility Model. However this contradicts with the outsourcing model. SaaS vendors have no liability if your data are ex-filtrated.

However SaaS is not bad. They are cheaper, more agile as long as we don't expect the same levels of unreasonable expectation of vendor accountability and liability.
