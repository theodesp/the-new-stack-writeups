Cloud pricing should be more granular with an emphasis on data management.

Enterprise use of cloud computing technologies is growing the fastest. The total economic impact of cloud technology could reach $6.2 trillion annually by 2025.

For the most part, cloud services charge on a per hour basis. More granular billing that charges based on the actual usage of compute, storage and networking makes a lot more sense. For example what lambda pricing is doing.

compute (CPU), memory (RAM), network I/O (Mbps) and storage I/O (IOPS). Measured every five minutes, the data can then show what resources are used the most. Calculations can then be defined by units of measurement, comparing consumption of the resources and calculating the average based on an hourly basis.

The greatest amount of usage determines the bill. If the room with the air conditioning is consuming the most electricity that essentially defines the overall cost of the kilowatt per hour.

Once an effective data measurement system is in place, the customer can form a budget strategy that does not lead to guessing about how much the resources they use might cost.
