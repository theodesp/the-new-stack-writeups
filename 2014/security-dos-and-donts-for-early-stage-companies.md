[Security Do’s and Don’ts for Early-Stage Companies](https://thenewstack.io/security-dos-and-donts-for-early-stage-companies/)

Web apps need to build security into your product, process, and company from day one. However this is not an easy task to do right.

---

You must Understand your Data. Keep secrets secret and maintain the durability and secrecy of valuable data.

---

Categorise: Low value data, Medium value data and High value data. You should spend the vast majority of your time thinking about how you protect that high-value data. A lot more startups are killed by bad products or lack of customers than hackers.

---

Let the pro do it. Use established, mainstream open-source frameworks and libraries. Use vetted cloud providers. Don’t build your own sign-in system. 

---

Use TLS everywhere, always. Buy a wildcard certificate for your domain and use TLS for database connections.

---

Separate secrets from code.  Never check in these API keys, passwords, or certificates! Use environmental variables.

---

Educate your employees. Spear phishing or accidents happen. Have ACLs in place. Use password managers. Use screen locks and firewalls.

---

Bother with crypto. Save encryption for when you can hire security professionals to build and operate a working system for you.

---

Be smart and don't try too hard. Eventually you’ll have a dedicated IT and security staff in house to assess and mitigate risks.
