Data is drawn to utility, therefore the majority of enterprise data in the cloud will be drawn to cloud services that provide the most utility.

There is a distinct difference between “Consumerized Shadow IT”, defined as a single “rogue” user interacting with unsanctioned cloud applications, and “Departmentalized Shadow IT” which is essentially no different than sanctioned SaaS applications, which are now included as a prominent piece of IT portfolios across industries.
